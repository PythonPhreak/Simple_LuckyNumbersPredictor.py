## Note
This is a simple and fun Python program for generating random lucky numbers for the popular Greek lottery game Tzoker. It also offers a basic prediction model for lucky numbers. Please note that the variables `c`, `e`, and `often_nums` can be adjusted over time by the user to adapt to real draw data. This can potentially improve the predictive model's performance.

This is my first program that I'm sharing here, so please forgive any shortcomings or omissions. You are welcome to use this code as you see fit. It's user-friendly and can be used directly, but make sure you have installed the 'opap' module.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.

Enjoy and good luck!
